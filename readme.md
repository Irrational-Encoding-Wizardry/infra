Infrastructure Definitions for IEW
==================================

DNS
---

Example File:
- `Examples/DNS/SRV.json`
- `Examples/DNS/Record.json`

Target Directory:
- `DNS/*.json`

The DNS folder contains DNS configurations for different projects.
Open up a Pull-Request to update these.
These changes are applied manually.
Contact cid-chan to expedite applying the new configuration.

If you don't want the IP to be publically accessible,
encrypt your JSON file with AGE and add the suffix ".age" to the filename.
Add yourself (if desired), as well as this public key as recipient: "age1n4exf98al9neg4f5gk9n2984zhgwmjvxkwjuwmxuq0nkhfthc3nsr0fe3h"
